I with the help of a friend with the coding, present to you an English/common to Toggish/kortok translator! (MY POOR WRISTS!)

I created this mainly for the simple fact I was a bit tired of just switching so everyone sees "Ambigor says something to someone in Toggish" I REFUSE TO DILUTE MY TOGGISH VERNACULAR TO SUCH BROAD SPECTRUM!

Anyways I like the language and like rp'n my learned Tog bard. Yea I'm going that route, so I would use words like Kinomi for Gnomes and Rakasi for Rakash etc etc, but I wanted more than just having to sift through the Gor'tog language book. So this was spawned.

WHAT YOU MUST KNOW:

1.Yes you can do phrases/sentences PLEASE DO NOT ADD PUNCTUATION such as commas and periods. But if it's actually in the name like Gor'Tog it's cool and should work.

2.Lowercase only, don't ask me why, my friend helped with the code and he explained it. I dunno.

3.Certain words if they do not translate in plural try singular version then add an s or vice versa (The Toggish language is rough, I just went 1 for 1 with Volume 1 language book for em.)

4.Things such as warrior mage and moon mage should be used with a hyphen (-) between them. example: warrior-mage moon-mage 

5.Some words may or may not be correct due to this translator doesn't account for adj/nouns etc because that would by far complicate the code further. I used the version of the words I figured would be more commonly used. (If you can correct this you can download the entire thing from plunker and improve upon it)

6. Enjoy it!

I feel like I have carpal tunnel now, but I'm glad I actually did this. This is simple code you can rework it for other races if you like (a friend of mine wants me to do rakash) but yea... not gunna happen willy nilly unless I'm really really into doing it.

ENJOY!
